# Feature Specification: Tamagitto - Developer Monitoring Tamagotchi

**Feature Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Chrome extension based 'tamagotchi' like app with a creature, person or plant that you have to care for. You'd click on the extension and click on the entity associated with your github repo. The entity is cared for by pushing git commits or generally advancing on development goals. Extension uses OAUTH to connect to github, user chooses repo to monitor and entity is generated via Gemini image gen. Python backend receives repo info. Agents monitor progress of commits (code quality, commit frequency) - if user fails to meet goals in timely manner their entity's condition deteriorates and dies. Static SPA shows screenshots and features with download link."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to gamify their coding habits by caring for a virtual entity that reflects their development consistency and code quality. They install the Chrome extension, connect their GitHub account, select a repository to monitor, and receive a unique AI-generated entity. The entity's health depends on their commit frequency and code quality - thriving with good practices and deteriorating with neglect.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has installed the extension, **When** they click the extension icon for the first time, **Then** they see OAuth login prompts for GitHub
2. **Given** user is authenticated with GitHub, **When** they select a repository from their list, **Then** a unique entity is generated and displayed with initial "healthy" status
3. **Given** user has an active entity, **When** they make quality commits regularly, **Then** the entity's health improves and visual appearance becomes more vibrant
4. **Given** user stops committing for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: time period not specified], **When** the monitoring period expires, **Then** entity health deteriorates and visual appearance degrades
5. **Given** entity health reaches critical low, **When** deterioration timer expires, **Then** entity "dies" and user receives notification
6. **Given** user visits the static SPA, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they see app screenshots, features, and download link

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user switches repositories mid-monitoring?
- How does system handle private repositories vs public ones?
- What occurs if GitHub API is temporarily unavailable?
- How are merge commits vs direct commits weighted differently?
- What happens if user revokes GitHub OAuth permissions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST authenticate users via GitHub OAuth
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select from their accessible GitHub repositories
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate unique visual entities using AI image generation for each selected repository
- **FR-004**: Backend MUST continuously monitor selected repository for new commits and analyze code quality metrics
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate and update entity health based on commit frequency and quality scores
- **FR-006**: Extension MUST display current entity status, health level, and visual representation
- **FR-007**: System MUST deteriorate entity health when commits don't meet [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific criteria for frequency and quality thresholds]
- **FR-008**: System MUST "kill" entity when health reaches zero and notify user
- **FR-009**: Static website MUST showcase app features, screenshots, and provide extension download link
- **FR-010**: System MUST store user authentication tokens securely
- **FR-011**: Backend MUST use agent-based analysis to evaluate commit quality including [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific quality metrics like test coverage, linting, complexity]
- **FR-012**: Extension MUST work across major Chromium-based browsers
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle rate limiting for GitHub API calls appropriately
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to view historical entity health trends
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to restart/reset their entity after death [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cooldown period or restrictions?]

### Key Entities
- **Developer Entity**: Virtual creature/plant/character with visual representation, health status, and associated repository
- **Repository Monitor**: Tracks commit history, analyzes code quality, maintains monitoring state
- **Health Metrics**: Quantified measures of entity wellbeing based on development activity
- **Commit Analysis**: Quality scores derived from agent evaluation of code changes
- **User Session**: GitHub authenticated user with selected repositories and active entities
