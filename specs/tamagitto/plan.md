# Implementation Plan: Tamagitto Developer Monitoring Tamagotchi

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: /Users/petrichor/Documents/hackathons/tamagitto/tamagitto-spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `tamagitto-spec.md`

## Summary
Create a Chrome extension-based Tamagotchi application that gamifies developer productivity by linking entity health to code quality and commit frequency. The system includes a browser extension frontend, Python backend with agent-based commit analysis, AI-generated entities, and a static promotional website.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.13, JavaScript ES2020+, HTML5/CSS3  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, google-adk, Chrome Extensions API, GitHub OAuth, Gemini Image Generation  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (for user sessions, entity states, commit history)  
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Jest (extension), Lighthouse (static site)  
**Target Platform**: Chrome/Chromium browsers, Linux VPS, Static hosting
**Project Type**: web (extension + backend + static site)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response, <2s extension load, <1s entity updates  
**Constraints**: GitHub API rate limits, OAuth security, cross-origin requests  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user concurrent monitoring, persistent entity states, real-time health updates

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Code Quality as Entity Health - ✅ ALIGNED
- Extension and backend code will use strict TypeScript compilation and mypy type checking
- Entity health calculation directly reflects code quality metrics from agent analysis
- Commit analysis algorithms will be thoroughly tested before implementation

### II. Consistent User Experience Across Components - ✅ ALIGNED  
- Unified visual design system across extension popup, backend responses, and static site
- Consistent OAuth flow and error handling patterns
- Entity visual representations maintain consistency across all touchpoints

### III. Test-Driven Entity Behavior - ✅ ALIGNED
- All entity state transitions, commit analysis, and deterioration logic will be test-covered
- Mock GitHub API responses for edge case testing
- Entity generation consistency validated through automated tests

### IV. Performance for Real-Time Monitoring - ✅ ALIGNED
- Sub-200ms response times for commit analysis endpoints
- Efficient GitHub API polling with proper rate limiting
- Extension popup loads instantly with cached entity state

**Initial Constitution Check**: ✅ PASSED - No violations identified

## Progress Tracking
- [x] **Initial Constitution Check**: All principles aligned, no violations
- [x] **Phase 0**: Research technical decisions and clarify requirements ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Phase 1**: Design data models, contracts, and development setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Post-Design Constitution Check**: Validate design against principles ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Phase 2 Planning**: Ready for task generation ✅ READY FOR `/tasks`

## Post-Design Constitution Check
*GATE: Re-evaluation after Phase 1 design completed.*

### I. Code Quality as Entity Health - ✅ MAINTAINED
- Database schema includes comprehensive quality metrics tracking
- Health calculation algorithm defined with specific scoring criteria
- Agent-based analysis pipeline designed for code quality assessment

### II. Consistent User Experience Across Components - ✅ MAINTAINED
- Unified API contracts ensure consistent data flow
- Extension UI patterns maintain visual consistency
- Error handling standardized across all components

### III. Test-Driven Entity Behavior - ✅ MAINTAINED
- Comprehensive testing strategy defined for all entity lifecycle events
- Mock GitHub API patterns established for reliable testing
- Contract tests specified for external integrations

### IV. Performance for Real-Time Monitoring - ✅ MAINTAINED
- WebSocket real-time updates with polling fallback designed
- Database indexing strategy optimized for frequent health queries
- Caching layers specified for entity states and repository data

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: ✅ PASSED - No new violations introduced

## Phase 0: Research (COMPLETED)

### Technical Decisions Required
1. **Database Schema**: Entity states, user sessions, commit analysis results
2. **GitHub API Integration**: OAuth flow, webhook vs polling strategy, rate limit handling
3. **Entity Generation**: Gemini API integration, image caching strategy
4. **Agent Architecture**: Commit analysis pipeline, quality metrics definition
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket vs polling for entity state changes
6. **Security**: Token storage, CORS configuration, API authentication

### Architecture Constraints
- **GitHub OAuth**: Extension content security policy limitations
- **Cross-Origin**: API calls from extension to backend domain
- **Performance**: Entity health calculations must be sub-200ms
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent repository monitoring
- **Reliability**: Handle GitHub API outages gracefully

## Phase 1: Design

### Data Model Requirements
- User entity with GitHub integration
- Repository monitoring configuration  
- Entity state with health metrics
- Commit analysis results
- Image generation cache

### API Contracts
- GitHub OAuth endpoints
- Repository selection and monitoring
- Entity health updates
- Commit analysis webhooks/polling
- Image generation requests

### Development Setup
- Docker containerization for backend
- Chrome extension development environment
- Static site deployment pipeline
- Database migrations and seeding
- Environment configuration management
